## Booting a KVS shim
After installing KVS to a raw shim, download & open the [Chrome Recovery Utility](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/chromebook-recovery-utili/pocpnlppkickgojjlmhdmidojbmbodfm?pli=1). <br />

<br />
Press the Settings (⚙️) icon in the top right, and press "Use Local Image". Select your built KVS shim, and then select your target USB / SD.

After flashing the USB/SD, insert the newly-flashed USB/SD into your target device. Once inserted, press ESC + REFRESH (↻) + PWR (⏻) and then press CTRL+D and then enter.

Once in Developer Mode, your screen should look similar to this:

Now, press ESC + REFRESH (↻) + PWR (⏻) again and it should load into KVS.

## DISCLAIMER
I am unable to provide any raw shim files directly. Raw shims are Google's property signed with their private keys. <br />
Any legal trouble you recieve due to possessing a raw shim for KVS is not my responsibility.
